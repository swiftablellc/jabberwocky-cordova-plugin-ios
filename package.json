  "description": "\n        The JabberwockyÂ® Head Tracking Kit (JabberwockyHTKit) is an open-source iOS framework, developed by Swiftable LLC, that provides a touch-free interface for existing iOS applications. Jabberwocky enables users to interact with an application by just moving their head. Head movement translates into the movement of a mouse-like cursor on the screen. Cursor location and blink events can be subscribed to allowing actions to be performed in Cordova.\n    ",
